# Deep Learning Assignment 1

In this assignment, I created interactive Jupyter notebooks using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to build mathematical models.

The notebooks offer hands-on experience with [regression models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis), allowing students to explore key concepts like model training, optimization, and visualization using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to better understand deep learning in action.

## Get Started

You can open the main notebook file [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb) using your favorite viewer.

Please check out the previous results or run the notebook to reproduce the results.
